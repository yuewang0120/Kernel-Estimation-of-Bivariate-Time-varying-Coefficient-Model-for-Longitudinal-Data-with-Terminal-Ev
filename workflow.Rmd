```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Simulation

A simulation with 1000 replications needs to be first executed. Run

```{r eval = FALSE}
source('code/simu.R')
```

This will generate an intermediate result, stored in "simu_result.RData" under code folder. Once this is done, run

```{r eval = FALSE}
source('code/figure1-2.R')
```

to generate Figure 1 and 2 in the paper.

Run

```{r eval = FALSE}
source('code/table1-2.R')
```

to print out Table 1 and 2 in the paper.

## Real Data Analysis

Since the dataset cannot be made publicly available, a pseudo dataset "usrds.RData" has been created. Readers can find the file under data folder.

similar to simulation, an intermediate result needs to be generated before further processing. Run

```{r eval = FALSE}
source('code/pseudo.R')
```

This will generate the file "pseudo_result.RData" under code folder. Once this is done, run

```{r eval = FALSE}
source('code/figure3.R')
```

to generate Figure 3 in the paper.

Run

```{r eval = FALSE}
source('code/table3-4.R')
```

to print out Table 1 and 2 in the paper.

## Supplementary material

Run

```{r eval = FALSE}
source('code/pseudo_full.R')
```

to generate "pseudo_full_result.RData" under code folder. Once this is done, run

```{r eval = FALSE}
source('code/figureS1.R')
```

to generate Figure S1 in the paper.

Run

```{r eval = FALSE}
source('code/likelihood_simu.R')
```

to generate "likelihood_simu_result.RData" under code folder. Once this is done, run

```{r eval = FALSE}
source('code/figureS2.R')
```

to generate Figure S2 in the paper.
